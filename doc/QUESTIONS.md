- What symbols should we encode? In which space / symbol representation should metrics be applied?
- Consider joint encoding of both polarizations?
- Limit or define the number of constellation points in the NN modulator.
- Consider the carrier and sampling frequency in modulator / demodulator?
- We should consider opeartion in time domain to include more realistic channel effects.
- Predict discrete constellation points or continous values in the complex plane?
